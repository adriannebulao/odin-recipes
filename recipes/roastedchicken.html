        <p>Roasted chicken never fails to impress, but it's surprisingly simple to make! This juicy roasted chicken recipe is perfect for beginner cooks and old pros alike.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter or margarine</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously inside and out with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Place 3 tablespoons of butter in chicken cavity; arrange dollops of remaining butter on the outside of chicken. Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces; place in the chicken cavity.</li>
            <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest for about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
